# GAN_MFS

## Overview

This project focuses on generating synthetic data using a Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) with a focus on maintaining the utility of the generated data. It includes tools for data sampling, anomaly removal, and calculating various metrics to evaluate the quality and utility of the synthetic data. The project also incorporates methods for comparing real and synthetic data using topological data analysis and correlation matrix analysis.

## Purpose

The primary purpose of this project is to provide a framework for generating synthetic datasets that closely resemble real-world data, with an emphasis on preserving statistical properties and utility for downstream tasks such as regression modeling. It aims to facilitate data augmentation, privacy preservation, and the creation of representative datasets for scenarios where real data is limited or sensitive.
